# Crypto-Prediction-using ML

First, you need to set up your CSVs or whatever files you're working with.
Next, make sure that you absolutely get all the paths correct otherwise the code will not run.
download all required dependencies and packages and set up Tensorboard for the GUI features that come with it, but its up to you if you really think you need it.
If you do, then make sure to downgrade python to the version that is supported by tensorboard.
Run more epochs to potentially get a better prediction rate, although that comes at the cost of computing power
